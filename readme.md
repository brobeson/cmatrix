# Matrix Builder

Matrix builder is a tool to run matrix builds of a C++ project on your local
system.

Build matrices on CI systems like Travis and Jenkins are great, but I want
similar functionality on my workstation. I prefer to ensure my project builds
with multiple tools before I commit and push.
